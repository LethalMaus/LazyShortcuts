<h2><b>Lazy Shortcuts</b></h2>

Have you ever been so lazy, that you couldn't be bothered navigating the settings to find and change a specific part of it such as Wi-Fi or Languages? Especially with a new phone, or when the phone is in a different language?

<u>Then fret no more!</u>

These lazy apps (yes more than one) will each navigate to your phone settings as defined. They're so lazy, that the app contains only <b>3 lines of code!</b>

The app will open, tell the phone <i>'Hey! open this setting for me will ya!'</i> and then close again. It does nothing else, literally.

No advertising, no extra presses, no views to be seen, literally just opens, sends the intent and closes. Don't believe me? Take a look at the code! It's open source and found here https://github.com/LethalMaus/LazyShortcuts

<i>'But why create and release this app if this is all what it does?'</i>
I work as an app developer in the IoT field and I test quite a few apps and IoT devices. These tests are ran on multiple phones with different languages and need to be constantly adjusted (changing the Wi-Fi network or the system language for example). Time is crucial and so are my nerves so if I find a way to make the process more 'lazy' then I will. 
I looked first to see if other apps were available only to find that the majority require opening the app and then pressing a button (just to show some advertising). I'm not a fan of that and I get a kick out doing something like this so its a win-win for me (and possibly you)
